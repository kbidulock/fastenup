                    <ol style="padding-top: 0;">
                        <li>
                            Read your manuals!
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Read your child restraint manual cover to cover. Don’t forget to also read the 
                                    seat belt, car seat and airbag sections of your vehicle manual. Both manuals 
                                    contain important safety instructions and information about installing and 
                                    using your restraint correctly.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Install your restraint using either the seatbelt or UAS (universal anchorage 
                            system), not both.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Never install a rear-facing seat in front of an active airbag.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure your restraint is securely installed – it should move no more than 2.5 
                            cm (1 inch) at the belt path when tugged side to side and front to back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tether every forward facing car seat to an approved anchor point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When rear-facing, your child’s harness straps should be located at or below their 
                            shoulders. When forward facing, your child’s harness straps should be located at 
                            or above their shoulders.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The chest clip should be placed level with your child’s armpits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t overdress your child - remove bulky layers before buckling to avoid full or
                            partial ejection in a collision.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conduct the “pinch” test at your child’s collarbone to make sure the harness is 
                            snug. If you can pinch a horizontal fold in the harness webbing, the harness is 
                            too loose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Never use an expired, recalled or damaged seat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be wary of purchasing used seats - it is important to know your car seat's
                            history as your child’s life is in the hands of the previous owner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure your child is riding in the right restraint for their age, height and 
                            weight. Child restraints are not milestones – don’t rush your child into their next 
                            stage too soon:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Rear face as long as possible (at least age 2).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Consider proper belt fit and maturity before moving to a booster seat
                                    (minimum ages 5 and up).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Children must pass the 5 step test before they can safely ride without a 
                                    booster (usually between ages 10-12).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Kids are safest in the back. Keep all children riding in the back seat until they 
                                    are 13 years old.
                                </li>
